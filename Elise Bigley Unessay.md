#For this unessay, I am going to write the most structured post yet: a list. 
##1. 
Digital and Humanities are a relationship. But also a challenge on what aspect you should emphasize. I've found that the only way to find out is to dive into the project and give yourself lots of time and REFLECT. Starting these projects early will make the process and final product so much more rewarding than scrambling to put the pieces together the night before. Which, by the way, is basically impossible with a digital project. It's a completely different world of assignment to our standard academic papers. 
##2. 
Digital work takes time, and is terrifying. However, the fact that the tasks seem daunting allow us to work harder and earlier to complete the projects. I think knowing our peers would be actively reviewing our projects when presented side-by-side encouraged us to add some flare to our projects.
##3. 
Digital work is not always fun. The process can be excruciating, but knowing that failing can only take you further helps. Also knowing that your professor is actively encouraging you to fail, because that means you've attempted something allows the entire process to be more inviting. Odd, I know. 
##4. 
Digital fairs are so much fun! It's like presenting your final paper to your class in the most creative way possible. No more PowerPoint! It was such a relaxed and gratifying experience. I think because of the amount of work we put into our projects and how many new things we had to learn in order to complete them, we were all so eager to show off our work but also celebrate our peers' hard work!
##5. 
Digital communities don't always have to be scary. [Github](https://github.com/) is an incredibly useful resource that allowed us to work together, but miles apart (not too many miles, mind you). Being able to merge files at the click of a button, not having to email and download multiple documents then upload into another file is amazing for group projects! This saved us so much time. Using [Slack](https://slack.com/) helped with our communication big time. Being able to instant message, send documents and files, video chat, and create group conversations is an incredibly useful tool for digital projects. Also, the /giphy tool is a sweet sweet bonus. 
##6. 
Digital work is never finished, but this list is.
